        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
    1. Use
      You may use our client for the sole purpose of experimentation. 
      You may not use this program to cause any harm and/or damage to 
      any servers even if it is stated that the purpose is to cause harm
      and/or damage. We do not track any information so the responsibility
      is on your hand. We also do not care if you use our client to cause
      harm and/or damage since that's what we are aiming for.
    
    2. Reproduction
      You may use the client to make your own client, but only if you add
      credits or fork from https://github.com/o7-Fire/Mindustry-Ozone. If
      you are caught to have our client without credits, you will be held
      accountable for every damage caused by the client and will be sued
      by the o7 External Affairs Group.
    
    3. Distribution
      You are allowed to distribute the client only if there are proper
      credits or fork from https://github.com/o7-Fire/Mindustry-Ozone.
      If you are caught to have our client without credits, you will be
      held accountable for every damage caused by the client and will be
      sued by the o7 External Affairs Group.
